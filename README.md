# Turn-Based Strategy Game

This is a grid-based turn-based strategy game inspired by One Piece with pixel art graphics. It includes:

- Grid-based movement with WASD keys (directional facing)
- Fatal water tiles, island/bridge layout, and a ship mechanic
- Four directional attack types (Light: Z, Medium: X, Heavy: Y, Special: V)
- Jumping (Spacebar), blocking (Shift key), dodge/dash (B key)
- A stamina system with regeneration and a combo system with cooldown
- Basic NPC AI and local multiplayer simulation
- Blockchain integration placeholders (saving game online, battle replays, matchmaking, character ownership)

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is ready to deploy on Vercel.
